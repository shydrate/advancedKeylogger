# advancedKeylogger #python #logfile #pm2
This is for knowledge purpose only. 
Keylogger file(Keylogger.py) is written in python which log every keystrokes from keyboard.
I have installed nodejs and pm2 package.
In Pm2_keylog.bat is a file which will build or starts the script.
The reason for pm2 is it will rerun the file if, it gets error or hangged 
I have crreated one more file called Launch.vbs.
In launch.vbs file i have written a script to run the pm2 batch in invisible mode.
As soon as the user logs in within 5sec the keystorkes gets logged
